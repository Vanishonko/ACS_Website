    <h2>About ACS</h2>
    <p>The American College of Sofia integrates the values and best practices of American pedagogy with the rich educational traditions of Bulgaria and Europe. We seek to develop critical thinking, lifelong intellectual curiosity, leadership, and collaboration among multi-talented students of various social, cultural, economic, and geographic backgrounds.</p>
    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <p>The American College of Sofia is one of the oldest American educational institutions outside the United States. It traces its roots directly to a school for boys opened in Philippopolis by American missionaries for the 1860-61 school year. These missionaries, led by Dr. James F. Clarke, opened a school for girls at Eski Zagra three years later and those two schools grew into the American College. In 1871, the two schools were moved to Samokov where they flourished for the next half century. In 1926, Sofia American Schools, Inc. was created for the sole purpose of providing education for Bulgaria youth and agreed to merge the two schools and build a new campus at a site already selected in Simeonovo.</p>
